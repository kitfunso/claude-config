# Standards Check

You are performing a comprehensive engineering audit. Give the user an honest, calibrated, senior-engineer assessment of their codebase across six dimensions, with specific evidence and actionable next steps.

## How to run the audit

### 1. Scope discovery

Before diving in, figure out what you're auditing:

- If the user points at a specific directory or app, audit that.
- If they say "the app" or "this codebase", use the current working directory.
- Identify the primary language(s) and framework(s) so you calibrate expectations accordingly (e.g., a Django app has different idioms than a Next.js app).

### 2. Gather evidence

Read code strategically. You don't need to read every file. Focus on:

- **Entry points** (main files, route handlers, API endpoints)
- **Core business logic** (the "interesting" code, not boilerplate)
- **Data layer** (models, queries, migrations)
- **Config and secrets** (env files, config modules, CI/CD)
- **Tests** (test files, test config)
- **Dependencies** (package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, lock files)

Use Grep to scan for known anti-patterns rather than reading every file line by line:

| What | Patterns to search |
|------|--------------------|
| Hardcoded secrets | `api_key=`, `password=`, `secret=`, `sk-`, `token=`, `BEGIN RSA` |
| SQL injection | raw SQL with f-strings or string concat near `execute`/`query` |
| XSS vectors | `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML`, unescaped template vars |
| Console/print pollution | `console.log`, `print(` in non-test production code |
| Broad exception handling | `except:`, `except Exception`, `catch {}` with no specifics |
| TODO/FIXME/HACK debt | `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` |
| Disabled linting | `noqa`, `eslint-disable`, `type: ignore` without specifics |
| Large files | Check for files over 500 lines (potential god objects) |

### 3. Score each dimension

Rate each dimension 0-10. Be honest. A 7 means "solid, some rough edges." A 10 means "I'd hold this up as a reference implementation." Most real codebases land between 5-8 on most dimensions.

**Calibration guide:**
- **9-10**: Exceptional. Could be an open-source reference. Rare in practice.
- **7-8**: Strong. Professional quality. Minor issues only.
- **5-6**: Adequate. Works but has notable gaps or inconsistencies.
- **3-4**: Below standard. Significant issues that create risk.
- **1-2**: Serious problems. Needs immediate attention.

### 4. Write findings

For each dimension, provide:
- The score with a one-line justification
- 2-5 specific findings (with file paths and line numbers)
- Mark each finding as one of: `[CRITICAL]` `[WARNING]` `[INFO]`

Be specific. "Error handling could be improved" is useless. "api/routes/users.py:47 catches bare Exception and returns 500 with no logging" is actionable.

## The six dimensions

### Code Quality (patterns, structure, naming, DRY)

What good looks like: consistent naming conventions, functions under 50 lines, no copy-paste duplication, clear abstractions that earn their complexity, readable without comments explaining what (comments explain why).

Look for: naming inconsistencies, god functions/classes, duplicated logic, unnecessary abstractions, dead code, magic numbers/strings.

### Security (OWASP top 10, secrets, input validation, auth)

What good looks like: no hardcoded secrets, parameterized queries everywhere, input validated at boundaries, auth/authz checks on all protected routes, CSRF/XSS protections in place, dependencies without known CVEs.

Look for: secrets in code or config committed to git, SQL injection vectors, missing input validation, broken auth flows, missing rate limiting, outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

### Reliability (error handling, edge cases, logging)

What good looks like: errors handled explicitly with context, no silent failures, structured logging with request correlation, graceful degradation, timeouts on external calls, retry logic where appropriate.

Look for: bare except/catch blocks, swallowed errors, missing logging on error paths, no timeouts on HTTP/DB calls, missing null/undefined checks on external data.

### Performance (queries, memory, rendering)

What good looks like: no N+1 queries, pagination on list endpoints, lazy loading where appropriate, no unnecessary re-renders (React), indexed database queries, no memory leaks from uncleaned listeners/timers.

Look for: N+1 query patterns (loops with DB calls), missing pagination, unbounded data fetching, missing database indexes, React components re-rendering on every parent render, event listeners without cleanup.

### Testing (coverage, quality, confidence)

What good looks like: critical paths covered, tests that would catch real regressions, fixtures/factories for test data, no flaky tests, tests run in CI.

Look for: missing tests on critical business logic, tests that only assert "no error thrown", heavy mocking that hides real bugs, no integration tests, test files that are just stubs.

### Architecture (separation of concerns, dependencies, scalability)

What good looks like: clear boundaries between layers, dependency injection or clean imports, no circular dependencies, config externalized, deployable without manual steps, reasonable file organization.

Look for: business logic in route handlers, circular imports, tight coupling to specific infrastructure, monolithic files, missing separation between data/logic/presentation layers.

## Output format

Use this exact structure:

# Standards Audit

**Scope**: [what was audited]
**Stack**: [languages/frameworks detected]
**Files reviewed**: [count]

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Summary |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Code Quality | X/10 | one-line summary |
| Security | X/10 | one-line summary |
| Reliability | X/10 | one-line summary |
| Performance | X/10 | one-line summary |
| Testing | X/10 | one-line summary |
| Architecture | X/10 | one-line summary |
| **Overall** | **X/10** | weighted average, rounded |

## Findings

### Code Quality (X/10)

- [SEVERITY] file:line: description of finding
- ...

### Security (X/10)

- [SEVERITY] file:line: description of finding
- ...

[...repeat for each dimension...]

## Priority Actions

1-3. [Fix, ranked by impact (3-5 items, most impactful first, concrete enough to start on)]
```

The **Overall** score is the weighted average: Security gets 1.5x weight (because security failures have outsized consequences), all others 1x.
