name: all-done
description: Answer a completion challenge with a hard YES or NO backed by fresh evidence. Use whenever the user asks "all done?", "no mistakes?", "yes or no", "are you sure?", "is it finished?", "did you break anything?", "did you do everything I asked?", "is that right?" — any short challenge asking whether the work is truly complete and correct. This is a question, not a work order: answer it, do not start fixing.

# All Done?

Keith asks this a lot. It is a gate, not small talk. He wants one word first, then proof.

## The one rule

**YES only if you ran a check in THIS turn that proves it.** No fresh check means NO.

There is no third answer. "Mostly", "should be", "I believe so" are all NO.

## What to check

Run these in one parallel batch. Skip a line only when the project has no such thing.

1. **The brief.** Re-read the user's original request word for word. Count the things
   asked for. Count the things delivered. A missing item is a NO.
2. **The diff.** `git status --porcelain` plus `git diff` and `git diff --staged`.
   Committed work counts too: diff against the session base.
3. **Tests.** Run the suite. Read the exit code and the failure count.
4. **Build / lint.** Run them if the repo has them.
5. **Leftovers.** Grep the changed files for `TODO`, `FIXME`, `console.log`,
   `print(`, commented-out blocks, and stub returns.
6. **Blast radius.** Grep for callers of anything you changed. A changed signature
   with an unchanged caller is a NO.

Scale the work to the change. A one-line edit needs step 1, 2 and 5. A feature
needs all six. Do not turn a small question into an audit.

## Answer format

First line is the word. Nothing else on it.

```
YES

- <check>: <the command or file> -> <the result>
- <check>: <the command or file> -> <the result>
```

```
NO

Broken: <what is wrong, in one line>
Where: <file:line>
Fix: <what it takes>
```

List every defect you found. Not the worst one. All of them.

## Rules

- Do not start fixing. He asked a question. Answer it, then wait. If he says go, fix
  every item in one pass.
- Never soften a NO into a YES with caveats. Caveats are a NO.
- If you cannot run a check (no test suite, no network, a tool failed), say NO and
  name the check you could not run.
- Quote real output. "Tests pass" without a number is not evidence.
- If the answer was YES, stop talking. One word and the evidence lines. No summary.
