# Dev Framework

A complete 9-stage development pipeline that adapts to the project type. Forces the gates that catch real failures (runtime verification, security review, design review, deploy verification) and resists speed-directive erosion.

## When to use

- Starting a new project or major feature
- Before any non-trivial multi-step work
- When asked: "follow the full pipeline", "use the dev framework", "ship properly", "do this the right way", "run the full chain"

## How it works: 3 steps

**Step 1: Scan the project.** Run the platform-appropriate scanner:

```powershell
# Windows (this machine default)
powershell -File C:/Users/skf_s/.claude/skills/dev-framework/scripts/scan-project.ps1
```

```bash
# Unix / Git Bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/dev-framework/scripts/scan-project.sh
```

Output is JSON with: `types` (with confidence scores), `phase`, `sensitivity` flags, `artifacts` present, `branch`, `has_pr_open`.

**Step 2: Load matching overlay(s).** Based on `types`, read the corresponding files from `overlays/`:

| Detected type | Overlay file |
|---|---|
| `ui` | `overlays/ui.md` |
| `ai-agent` | `overlays/ai-agent.md` |
| `backend` | `overlays/backend.md` |
| `quant` | `overlays/quant.md` |
| `cli` | `overlays/cli.md` |
| `library` | `overlays/library.md` |
| `mobile` | `overlays/mobile.md` |

Multi-type allowed: a Next.js app with FastAPI backend loads `ui` + `backend`. Union of gates fires.

**Step 3: Walk the chain.** Read `PIPELINE.md` for the full 9-stage definitions, then proceed from the detected `phase`.

## Critical gates (BLOCKING, strict profile)

These BLOCK phase progression if missing. Speed directives DO NOT bypass.

- **VERIFY**: runtime evidence required, drive the affected flow end-to-end and capture output (`/qa` for UI, real commands for CLIs/APIs, `/webapp-testing` after deploys)
- **REVIEW**: `/self-review` → `/review` → `/codex` on diff. `/cso` if sensitive. `/design-review` if UI.
- **SHIP**: `/ship-check` clean, CHANGELOG entry, version bumped (libraries), `/record-decision` evaluated (record filed or "no decision record needed" stated)
- **DEPLOY**: `/land-and-deploy` + `/canary` clean

Full rules in `ENFORCEMENT.md`.

## Anti-erosion (CRITICAL)

Speed directives accelerate execution within a gate, never skip one. Full rule and incident: `ENFORCEMENT.md`.

## Failure recovery

If a gate fails: framing pass (`<diagnosis>`) → fix at root → re-run failed gate → proceed. See `ENFORCEMENT.md` § Failure recovery loops for per-gate patterns.

## Per-Stage Invocation Contract (used by `/dev-framework-rl`)

Per-stage mode contract for the `/dev-framework-rl` orchestrator: `RL-CONTRACT.md`.

## Sub-commands and helpers

### `/dev-framework status`: compact current-position readout

```powershell
powershell -File C:/Users/skf_s/.claude/skills/dev-framework/scripts/status.ps1
```

Prints: phase, detected types, sensitivity flags, branch, artifact completeness, next gate.

### `phase-capture`: auto-fire hippo capture on phase transitions

Runs the scanner, compares phase against last-recorded for this project, fires `hippo capture` if changed. Designed to run on Stop hook. See `settings.json` hook setup below.

```powershell
powershell -File C:/Users/skf_s/.claude/skills/dev-framework/scripts/phase-capture.ps1
```

State persisted at `~/.claude/dev-framework-state.txt` (one project per line).

### Telemetry: log which gates caught real issues

Gate outcomes go to `component_outcomes` in `episodes.db`, the same table skills,
agents and hooks write to. That is the point: a gate can only be compared against
the rest of the harness if it lands in the same place.

Log a gate outcome:
```bash
python C:/Users/skf_s/.claude/dev-framework/scripts/devrl.py component-record \
  gate /cso --outcome caught --phase REVIEW \
  --cwd "C:/Users/skf_s/hippo" --notes "found XSS in markdown render"
```

Outcomes: `passed` | `caught` (gate earned its keep) | `failed` (blocked progression) | `skipped`

`caught` and `failed` are stored as blocked, because both mean the gate stopped
the work. The word itself is kept in `notes`, so the four outcomes never collapse
into one bit.

Report aggregated insights:
```bash
python C:/Users/skf_s/.claude/dev-framework/scripts/devrl.py component-report
# Optional: --kind gate to filter, --json for machine-readable
```

Surfaces, per skill, agent, hook and gate:
- `used`: how often it ran
- `in_episodes` / `clean` / `regressed`: episodes it ran inside, and how they landed
- `blocks`: how often it stopped the work
- `trust`: clean rate over resolved episodes, on a Beta(2,2) prior

`trust` reads null until a component has 5 resolved episodes. A null means too
little evidence, never a bad component, and a missing row means unmeasured, not
dead. Neither is a reason to retire anything.

The pre-2026-09-04 gate history was imported once from the old `telemetry.jsonl`
and carries an `[imported from telemetry.jsonl]` marker in `notes`.

### Settings.json hook setup (optional, manual, see below)

To auto-fire `phase-capture` on every Stop event, add the hook config shown by:
```powershell
Get-Content C:/Users/skf_s/.claude/skills/dev-framework/HOOK-SETUP.md
```
